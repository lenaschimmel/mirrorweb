It features two webviews within a single activity, with the "upper" one rotated by 180 degrees.

## Apk download
You can download the first alpha release [here](https://lenaschimmel.de/static/mirrorweb/mirrorweb.apk).

## Development note
This app was coded quickly and dirtily in about one hour. It's based on Android Studio's `FullScreenActivity` but since something was broken with that, some of the code was commented out.
